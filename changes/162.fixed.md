Fixed commented-out tests in test_api.py that were previously marked with FIXME, ensuring all API endpoint tests are now functional and passing. Fixed test_basic.py to check docs group instead of dev group for documentation dependencies, and removed griffe from docs/requirements.txt since it's a dev dependency.
