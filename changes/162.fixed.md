Fixed commented-out tests in test_api.py that were previously marked with FIXME, ensuring all API endpoint tests are now functional and passing. Fixed test_basic.py to check docs group instead of dev group for documentation dependencies, and removed griffe from docs/requirements.txt since it's a dev dependency. Fixed Python 3.10 compatibility issue in test_jobs.py by using patch.object() instead of string-based @patch() decorators for unittest.mock patching.
